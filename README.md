## Meet Base Camp Spring Web Application

### The Problem & It's Solution

Base Camp is slowly gaining its deserved attention across North Mississippi. However, that attention is still causing confusion on exactly what Base Camp will be like. This problem is occuring for applicants, visitors, and new students. To help Base Camp be as transparent and provide that information, this project is driven to solve that problem. The project includes a Day in the Life for students to view, Tips for new students, Coursework Details to understand before starting the year off, Student Testimonials to show the validity of Base Camp's program, a Trial link to get a "taste", the application itself, an application tracker, and ALumni Statistics to show where our graduates end up at.

### Prior Art

Base Camp has been using its website to give knowledge to the public and its Google Docs application for students applying. I am taking both of those and combining it into the Meet Base Camp Web Application with more twists to it. You can get to know the coursework set out for students clearer, look at testimonials and alumni statistics to give a clearer validity, and track the status of the application yourself.

### Core User Workflow

There will be three views assigned to a user. A user can be an applicant with an account, an admin to be able to change statuses or view applications, and a user can be a normal visitor to the site. Everything is available to a visitor except for application questions, application tracker, and admin privileges to update statuses. An admin is limited to changing statuses and viewing applications. An applicant can view everything except for admin privileges.
